## Elliott Smith's Valence
Elliott Smith is generally known as a pretty sad dude, so I wanted to see which albums have the biggest valence ratings. It doesn't explain much yet but I had a lot of difficulties with the making of the plot and coding. 

```{r sadness, echo=TRUE}
library(spotifyr)
sadness <- get_artist_audio_features("eliott smith")
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2) 
ggplot(sadness, aes(x=album_name, y=valence)) + geom_col() + theme_gray() + ggtitle("valence of Elliott Smith's albums")
```
